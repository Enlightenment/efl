Edje 0.5.0

A graphical layout and animation library for animated resizable, compressed and
scalable themes.

It's current under development and isn't complete. See src/lib/edje_private.h
for a list of FIXME's to do. Hopefully it will be complete in a few weeks.

Quick start-up guide:

1. You need eet from the HEAD cvs branch (must be up-to-date)

  cvs co e17/libs/eet
  cd e17/libs/eet
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

2. You need evas from the HEAD branch built with eet loader support.

  cvs co e17/libs/evas
  cd e17/libs/evas
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  cd
  
3. You need ecore from the HEAD cvs branch

  cvs co e17/libs/ecore
  cd e17/libs/ecore
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

4. You need embryo from the HEAD cvs branch

  cvs co e17/libs/embryo
  cd e17/libs/embryo
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

5. You need imlib2 installed. any reelease from 1.0.0 on will do.
6. You already have edje. now build it:

   ./autogen.sh
   make
   sudo make install

You now want to go test it out. first you'll need to make an edje .eet file.
   
   cd data
   ./e_logo.sh
   
Now you can view the edje you just built:
   
   edje ./e_logo.eet
   
You can view multilpe files at once with the edje test program:
   
   edje ./e_logo.eet ./e_logo.eet ./e_logo.eet
   
to view the same one 3 times.
   
You can read the source fuile that builds the edje .eet file by looking at:

   data/src/e_logo.edc

Another test file is also there:

   data/src/test.edc
   
The test file doesn't build anything useful at the moment.
