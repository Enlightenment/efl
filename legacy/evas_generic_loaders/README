Requirements:

  libc
  libm
  zlib

Recommended:
  gstreamer
  poppler
  libraw
  libspecter


These are additional "generic" loaders for Evas that are stand-alone
executables that evas may run from its generic loader module. This
means that if they crash, the application loading the image does not
crash also. In addition the licensing of these binaries will not
affect the license of any application that uses Evas as this uses a
completely generic execution system that allows anything to be plugged
in as a loader.

Generic loaders currently provided:

  XCF (.xcf .xcf.gz)

  PDF (using poppler)
    use -key option to specific what page to get and load options for size
    Should we add mupdf ?

  PS (using libspectre)
    use -key option to specific what page to get and load options for size
    Should we use directly libgs ?

  RAW (using libraw)

  MPG/AVI/OGV/MOV/MKV/WMV etc. (using Gstreamer)
    Should we add libxine and vlc ?

Possible fun ones in future:

  DVI (using DVIlib, see edvi)

  DJVU (using libdjvu)

  PPT/PPTX
    (beats me how u can render a page from these without a whole
     office impl - but worth a try? libopenoffice/libllibreoffice if
     it ever happens?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

  ./configure
  make
(as root unless you are installing in your users directories):
  make install

NOTE:
  you should put generic loaders in the same prefix as Evas or they
will not be found.
