           This is a constructor function and can only be called before

           This property overrides the global EFL configuration option
           "accel_preference" for this single window, and accepts the same
           syntax.

           The $accel string is a freeform C string that indicates
           what kind of acceleration is preferred. Here "acceleration" generally
           refers to rendering and the hardware with which the unit application renders GUIs.
           This may or may not be honored but a best attempt will
           be made. Known strings are as follows:

           "gl", "opengl" - try use OpenGL.
           "3d" - try to use a 3d acceleration unit.
           "hw", "hardware", "accel" - try any acceleration unit (best possible)
           "none" - use no acceleration but software instead (since 1.16)

           Since 1.14, it is also possible to specify some GL properties for the GL
           window surface. This allows applications to use GLView with depth, stencil
           and MSAA buffers with direct rendering. The new accel preference string
           format is thus "{HW Accel}[:depth{value}[:stencil{value}[:msaa{str}$]$]$]".

           Accepted values for depth are for instance "depth", "depth16", "depth24".
           Accepted values for stencil are "stencil", "stencil1", "stencil8".
           For MSAA, only predefined strings are accepted: "msaa", "msaa_low",
           "msaa_mid" and "msaa_high". The selected configuration is not guaranteed
           and is only valid in case of GL acceleration. Only the base acceleration
           string will be saved (e.g. "gl" or "hw").

           Full examples include:

           "gl", - try to use OpenGL
           "hw:depth:stencil", - use HW acceleration with default depth and stencil buffers
           "opengl:depth24:stencil8:msaa_mid" - use OpenGL with 24-bit depth,
                8-bit stencil and a medium number of MSAA samples in the backbuffer.

           Note that this option may be overriden by environment variables
           or the configuration option "accel_preference_override".

           The user can request the display server to start moving or resizing

           This API can only be called if none of the following conditions is
           true:

           1. Called in the absence of a pointer down event,
           2. Called more than once before a pointer up event,
           3. Called when the window is already being resized or moved,
           4. Called with an unsupported combination of modes.

           Right usage:
           1. Pointer (mouse or touch) down event,
           2. @.move_resize_start called only once with a supported mode,
           3. Pointer (mouse or touch) up event.

           If a pointer up event occurs after calling the function, it
           automatically ends the window move and resize operation.

           Currently, only the following 9 combinations are allowed, and
           possibly more combinations may be added in the future:
           1. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.move
           2. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.top
           3. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.bottom
           4. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.left
           5. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.right
           6. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.top | @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.left
           7. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.top | @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.right
           8. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.bottom | @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.left
           9. @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.bottom | @Efl.Ui.Win_Move_Resize_Mode.right

           In particular move and resize cannot happen simultaneously.

           Note: the result of this API can only guarantee that the request has
           been forwarded to the server, but there is no guarantee that the
