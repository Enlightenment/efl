@section intro What is Elementary?

This is a VERY SIMPLE toolkit. It is not meant for writing extensive desktop
applications (yet). Small simple ones with simple needs.

It is meant to make the programmers work almost brainless but give them lots
of flexibility.

License: LGPL v2 (see COPYING in the base of Elementary's source). This
applies to all files in the source here.

Acknowledgements: There is a lot that goes into making a widget set, and
they don't happen out of nothing. It's like trying to make everyone
everywhere happy, regardless of age, gender, race or nationality - and
that is really tough. So thanks to people and organisations behind this,
aslisted in the Authors section above.
