        1.0.0 release

2011-01-30  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added "UNDER" cursor mode.
        * Added auto-alignment to text parts, just set text.alignment to -1 to
          activate it. It's only relevant to TEXT parts, textblock objects
          already have that by default.

2011-02-01  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

2011-02-27  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added size_range property to TEXT parts in edje files.
	This lets you limit the size of the font that will be used.
	Especially useful when using fit.

2011-03-10  WooHyun Jung

        * Fix: Emit clicked signal on entry if still in - missing.

2011-03-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Correctly propagate recursive event with existing and non existing
	part.

2011-03-11  Cedric BAIL

2011-03-19  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Change edje_decc to only use edje_cc as the compiler for security
        and correctness reasons.

2011-03-23  Brett Nash (nash)

	* Move some of edje over to use smart clipper in evas.  This _should_
	be transparent to users.

2011-03-30  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* text.align (only the vertical part) now works for textblock.

2011-04-1  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        param (optional). Default as before.

        * size_min_restricted_calc: Fixed textblock handling.

2011-05-15  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry - New API: added edje_object_part_text_append which appends
	   text to the end of the textblock part. This lets us do cool thing
	   like population of textblock using idler.

2011-05-16  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add new interpolation modes for programs to make animation
        much easier. Added: ACCEL_FAC, DECEL_FAC, SIN_FAC, DIVIS,
        BOUNCE, SPRING (also made short name versions of the long ones
        possible too).

2011-05-19  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry: Don't emit "cursor,changed" when setting the text, because
	   the cursor really didn't change, it's more like a new cursor.
	   Also, when setting position, don't do anything if position is as it
	   was.

2011-05-27  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Improve performance on create/delete of edje objects by using
        evas freeze and thaw calls. May help in certain pathological
        situations.

2011-05-27  Cedric Bail

	* Improve performance by avoiding walking eina_list for nothing
	when deleting member_class.

2011-06-09  Cedric Bail

	* Fix external usage in sub group to have the proper parents.

2011-06-11  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Fix an issue with ellipsis not working properly with small
	  text parts.

2011-06-21  Cedric Bail

	* Make it possible to define part.description.max only on one axis.

2011-07-24  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Add signals entry,paste,request,1 (PRIMARY) and entry,paste,request,3 (CLIPBOARD)
          to differentiate between paste types
        * Add entry,selection,request for signalling ctrl+a in an entry
