 * This function creates a new Edje smart object, returning its @c
 * Evas_Object handle. An Edje object is useless without a (source)
 * file set to it, so you'd most probably call edje_object_file_set()
 * afterwards, like in:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *edje;
 *
 * edje = edje_object_add(canvas);
 * if (!edje)
 *   {
 *      fprintf(stderr, "could not create edje object!\n");
 *      return NULL;
 *   }
 *
 * if (!edje_object_file_set(edje, "theme.edj", "group_name"))
 *   {
 *      int err = edje_object_load_error_get(edje);
 *      const char *errmsg = edje_load_error_str(err);
 *      fprintf(stderr, "could not load 'group_name' from theme.edj: %s",
 *      	errmsg);
 *
 *      evas_object_del(edje);
 *      return NULL;
 *   }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note You can get a callback every time edje re-calculates the object
 * (either due to animation or some kind of signal or input). This is called
 * in-line just after the recalculation has occurred. It is a good idea not
 * to go and delete or alter the object inside this callbacks, simply make
 * a note that the recalculation has taken place and then do something about
 * it outside the callback. to register a callback use code like:
 *
 * @code
 *    evas_object_smart_callback_add(edje_obj, "recalc", my_cb, my_cb_data);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see evas_object_smart_callback_add()
 *
 * @note Before creating the first Edje object in your code, remember
 * to initialize the library, with edje_init(), or unexpected behavior
 * might occur.
