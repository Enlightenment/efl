 * clipping one, so the resulting color for the former will be "RESULT = (OBJ *

 * lists (i.e. object 1 clips object 2, which clips object 1): the behavior of
 * Evas is undefined in this case.
 *
 * Objects which do not clip others are visible in the canvas as normal; those
 * that clip one or more objects become invisible themselves, only affecting
 * what they clip. If an object ceases to have other objects being clipped by
 * it, it will become visible again.

 * The visibility of an object affects the objects that are clipped by it, so
 * if the object clipping others is not shown (as in

 * it gets implicitly removed from the old clipper's domain and is made now to
 * be clipped by its new clipper.
 *
 * If @c clip is @c null, this call will disable clipping for the object i.e.
 * its visibility and color get detached from the previous clipper. If it
 * wasn't, this has no effect.
