   [[A custom layout engine for @Efl.Ui.Box that stacks items.

     Items will be stacked on top of each other (in the Z direction) meaning that, in the absence of transparency,
     only the last item added through the @Efl.Pack interface will actually be visible.

     This can be useful to display transparent objects on top of each other, for example.
