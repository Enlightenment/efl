        * Add ecore_x_mouse_in_send() and ecore_x_mouse_out_send()
        * Add ecore_x illume access control/action atoms+api's

2012-05-24  Doyoun Kang

        * Add Ecore_X_Error_Code enumeration in ecore_x

2012-05-24  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix ecore-thread scheduling issue where re-scheduled threads
        will hold a loop busy and not allow feedback workers to run,
        so now have fairer scheduling.
        * Allow 16 * cpu num for worker threads (default still cpu num)

2012-05-25  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix ecore mainloop issue if you begin the mainloop, keep a
        timer around, quit mainloop, then start it again expecting the timer
        to keep ticking off. also happens to be an issue with
        iterating the mainloop.

2012-05-25  Rob Bradford

        * Make ecore_{software_x11, software_x11_8, software_x11_16, wayland,
        directfb}_window_get return 0 if the Ecore_Evas was not created with
        the appropriate constructor.

2012-05-29 Rob Bradford

        * Initial cursor support for Wayland:
        * Add api to the ecore_wl_input_ namespace to allow setting the buffer
        to use for the pointer and for loading a named cursor from a cursor
        theme. Under the Wayland protocol the cursor is associated with the
        input device.
        * Add helper functions to ecore_wl_window to set the cursor based on
        the active pointer input device for the window.
        * Load the cursor theme when the SHM interface is ready and provide an
        API call to provide a wl_cursor for a given name.
        * Add API to restore to the default cursor and then use that when the
        pointer enters the surface to ensure compliance with the Wayland
        protocol.

2012-05-30  Cedric Bail

	* Force cancel of all running Ecore_Thread on shutdown.
	* Make Ecore_Thread work reliabily when main loop isn't running.

2012-05-30  Mariusz Grzegorczyk

	* Small fix to ecore-evas buffer engine on resize to make the
        right kind of buffer cavas (ARGB32 vs RGB32).

2012-05-30 Leif Middelschulte (T_UNIX)

        * Add ECORE_X_RANDR_OUTPUT_POLICY_ASK

2012-06-04 Mike Blumenkrantz

        * ECORE_{CON,IPC}_NO_PROXY now available for disabling proxying on certain connections
        * Added new resolver method: dns.c -- This is used by default now when ipv6 is enabled
          and c-ares support is disabled.

2012-06-06 Rob Bradford

        * Ecore_Wayland: Enhance the keyboard input handling
        * Associate the keymap with the input device rather than the display
        since you could could have different keymaps associated with different
        devices.
        * Increase the size of character arrays used for the string
        representations of the keyname, keysym and for the string
        representing the key.
        * Re-enable the code that converts the keysym to a printable definition
        - this is required where the keysym is not the same as the printable
        definition

2012-06-06 Rob Bradford

	* Ecore_Wayland: Update to protocol change - axis events are now fixed point numbers

2012-06-11 Rob Bradford

	* Ecore_Wayland: Add missing null pointer checks on input device
	deletion (ticket #1031). Not all devices are keyboards.

2012-06-11  Jihoon Kim (jihoon)

        * ibus-immodule: Add immodule for supporting ibus.

2012-06-12  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Fixed bug in ecore-file monitoring with inotify where watching a file
          that was deleted broke the world.

2012-06-15 Rob Bradford

	* Ecore_Wayland: Port to latest Wayland protocol. The cursor for a
	pointer is now a surface rather than a buffer.

2012-06-15 Rob Bradford

	* Ecore_Wayland: Drop unused timestamp from configure event. Rationale:
	- timestamp isn't used by the handler for this event
	- configure event we receive from the compositor doesn't have a timestamp
	- ecore_wl_window_maximized_set and ecore_wl_window_fullscreen_set had
	  an implicit requirement that the window had keyboard focus to retrieve
	  a timestamp that wasn't used. This removes that requirement and fixes
	  ticket #1030.

2012-06-22 Vincent Torri

	* ecore_exe: fix compilation on fedora 18.

2012-06-23  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix small problem with xim module and if xim input context is
        destroyed. causes crashes next focus. track ic and set to NULL.

2012-06-27 Sebastian Dransfeld

	* Fix xim module to pass of Windows key as Mod4, not Mod5
	* Add support for AltGr key in X

2012-06-28  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Add compose sequence handling to ecore_input to be able to
        query a sequence of keysyms for a final compose string (utf8)
        that you free if you get it.

2012-07-02  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Fix crash which occurred in ecore-con when dns resolution failed
          immediately due to lack of connectivity

2012-07-03  Cedric Bail

	* Fix unitialized use of Ecore_X_Atom.

2012-07-03 Christopher Michael

	* Merge Tizen EFL changes to upsteam.
	* Add ecore_evas functions to get/set profiles
	* Fix GL buffer. some GL drivers are doing buffer copy in a separate thread.
		we need to check whether GL driver sends SYNC_DRAW_DONE msg afger copying
		that are required in order to exactly render. - added by gl77.lee
	* Add Ecore_X atoms for Illume Rotate Window
	* Add event callbacks for Ecore_Imf Input Panel
	* Add functions to retrieve input panel geometry & state from Ecore_Imf.

2012-07-05  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Add ecore_evas_screen_dpi_get()
        * Fix ecore_evas_screen_geometry_get(0 for x11 to return zone
          pos/size as it should.
        * Fix ecore-fb to use key repeat like x so apps dont break in fb
        * Fix ecore-fb string lookup table to include ctrl+keys
        * Fix ecore-fb to trap sigint (ctrl+c) so it doesnt exit your fb app
        * Fix ecore-fb mouse to swap button 2 and 3 ro work right.

2012-07-13  Jiyoun Park

        * Fix bug in Ecore_extn to call pre/post render function

2012-07-16  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix ecore-x selection handling to fall back to getting
          selection directly if getting targets fails. This fixes e17 to
          elm cnp.

2012-08-01  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Add ecore_main_fd_handler_file_add() for integrating file descriptors
          from regular files into the main loop

2012-08-01  Rob Bradford

	* Support setting fullscreen on Ecore_Evas's under the Wayland engine
	before they are visible. The fullscreening will then be applied when
	they become visible.

2012-08-01  Rob Bradford

	* Use libxkbcommon function to map keysym to unicode characters in the
	Wayland backend. Removing the need to have our own function to do this
	and increasing the range of supported keysms. Fixes #1105.

2012-08-03  Rob Bradford

	* In the Wayland backend handle the case that events can be received
	for surfaces that have been since destroyed - the client side
	marshaller changes the pointer to NULL to when the object is destroyed
	on the client side. Fixes #1258.

2012-08-09  Cedric Bail

	* Correctly shutdown Ecore_Thread.
	* Add a way to reset Ecore_Thread internal pipe after a fork via ecore_fork_reset.

2012-08-13  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix ecore fork reset function to allow for callbacks to be
          attached so ecore-evas can reset evas async fd on fork.

2012-08-13  Vincent Torri

        * Fix segmentation fault when fd_set pointers are NULL on Windows

2012-08-18  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Add xkb change events patch from trac.

2012-08-27  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Add ecore_x custom blanker screensaver enable/disable - cant
          do e17 properly without so add in even in freeze.

2012-08-27  Vincent Torri

        * Fix segmentation fault in ecore_thread on Windows as PHS
	  was returning a wrong value.
