 *
 * Emotion is a library that allows playing audio and video files, using one of
 * its backends (gstreamer and xine).
 *
 * It is integrated into Ecore through its mainloop, and is transparent to the
 * user of the library how the decoding of audio and video is happening. Once
 * the objects are created, the user can set callbacks to the specific events
 * and set options to this object, all in the main loop (no threads are needed).
 *
 * Emotion is also integrated with Evas. The emotion object returned by
 * emotion_object_add() is an Evas smart object, so it can be manipulated with
 * default Evas object functions. Callbacks can be added to the signals emitted
 * by this object with evas_object_smart_callback_add().

 * @section intro What is Emotion?
 *
 * A media object library for Evas and Ecore.
 *
 * @section work How does Emotion work?
 *
 * The Emotion library uses Evas smart objects to allow you to manipulate the
 * created object as any other Evas object, and to connect to its signals and
 * process them when needed. It's also possible to swallow Emotion objects
 * inside Edje themes, and expect it to behave as a normal image or rectangle
 * when regarding to its dimensions.
 *
 * To instantiate an Emotion object, the simple code below is enough:
 *
 * @code
 * em = emotion_object_add(e);
 * emotion_object_init(em, NULL);
 *
 * emotion_object_file_set(em, file_path);
 *
 * evas_object_move(em, 0, 0);
 * evas_object_resize(em, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
 * evas_object_show(em);
 *
 * emotion_object_play_set(em, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @todo Complete documentation of API - in progress
