Eeze is a library for manipulating devices through udev with a simple and fast
api. It interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as
udisks/upower or hal, to immediately gather device information the instant it
becomes known to the system.  This can be used to determine such things as:
  * If a cdrom has a disk inserted
  * The temperature of a cpu core
  * The remaining power left in a battery
  * The current power consumption of various parts
  * Monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices
  
Each of the above examples can be performed by using only a single eeze
function, as one of the primary focuses of the library is to reduce the
complexity of managing devices.
