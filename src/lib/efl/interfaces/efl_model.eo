     A model in EFL can have a set of key-value properties, where key can only be a string.
     The value can be anything within an Eina_Value. If a property is not yet available EAGAIN is returned.

     Additionally a model can have a list of children. The fetching of the children is asynchronous, this has the advantage of
     having as few data sets as possible in the memory itself.

                 @.children_slice_get behaves in two different ways, it may
                 provide the slice if $count is non-zero
                 OR full range otherwise.

                 Since 'slice' is a range, for example if we have 20 children a
                 slice could be the range from 3(start) with 4(count), see:

                 child 0  [no]

                 child 6  [yes]
                 child 7  [no]

                 Optionally the user can call @.children_count.get to know the
                 number of children so a valid range can be known in advance.

                 See @.children_count.get

                 Note: The returned children will live only as long as the future
                 itself. Once the future is done, if you want to keep the object
