Edje 1.7.0

Changes since Edje 1.2.0:
-------------------------

Additions:
    * Add edje_watch to monitore change on edje source.
    * Emit ['edje,change,file', 'edje'] when the file change on disk.
    * edje_player will automatically reload the file when it change on disk.
    * Add SPACER part. This part are not putting anything into the canvas. So lighter and faster to
    process (Use it to replace RECT part that are never visible and never catch any event).
    * Add accessibility flags and API to retrieve the relevant part.
    * Emit signal when flagged part size get to zero.
    * Warn at compile time about forgotten image.
    * Stop compilation when clipping to a non RECT part.

Improvements:
    * Allocate once and reuse Evas_Map.
    * Make edje_cc faster by improving the parser, mapping file in memory and using threads.
    * Made state index optional in EDC files and Embryo scripts.
    * Improve speed of color_class lookup by using an Eina_Hash.

Fixes:
    * Add missing files in the tarballs.
    * Prevent crash when running nested edje_object_signal_emit with edje_object_signal_callback_{add,del}.
    * Do actually verify that the file on disk is different from the file we have loaded.
    * Preserve user drag, box and table information during call of edje_object_file_set.
    * Fix table and text when fixed point is turned on.
    * Clamp image tween to never underflow also.
    * [entry] display preedit string even though there is no attribute
    * Fix shutdown of Edje_Multisense.
    * Reduce potential reentrant issue when using edje_object_signal_emit.
    * Call edje_object_message_signal_process also on GROUP part Edje object.
    * Remove memory leak when alias are present in the edj file.
    * Properly destroy color_class and text_class on an Edje_Object.
