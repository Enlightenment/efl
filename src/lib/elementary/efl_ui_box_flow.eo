{
   [[A Flow Box is a customized type of @Efl.Ui.Box. It will fill along the axis selected with
     @Efl.Ui.Layout_Orientable.orientation (which defaults to Horizontal), until items will no
     longer fit in the available space, at which point it will begin filling items in a new
     row/column after the current one.
     This is useful if an application wants to e.g., present a group of items and wrap them onto
     subsequent lines when the number of items grows too large to fit on the screen.
     Adding or removing items in the middle re-arrange the rest of the items as expected.
