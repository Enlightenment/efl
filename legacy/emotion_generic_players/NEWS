Improvements:

   * Simplify player version dir fallback to match efl 1.9 simplification changes
   * Emotion_generic_players - commented out unused func.
   * Emotion VLC: no more need to send the size twice.
   * Emotion VLC: use Eina_Bool instead of int for bools.
   * Emotion VLC: defer the resource free until the video is actually stopped.

Fixes:

     The EM_CMD_STOP command do not have any parameter so it must be
     handled in the first call of the pipe.
   * Check for libvlc >= 2.0 as a minimum as we use 2.x funcs
   * Emotion VLC: remove quite all the old hacks from loading stage which fixes the problem that
     audio was audible on start
   * Emotion VLC: fix the random-player-stop bug !!
   * Emotion VLC: fix send position_change while paused.
   * Emotion VLC: recreate the player when end reached.
   * Emotion VLC: fix the volume/mute bug.
