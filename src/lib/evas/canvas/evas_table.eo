           Todo: consider aspect hint and respect it.

           @Evas.Object_Table.Homogeneous_Mode.none
           If table does not use homogeneous mode then columns and rows will
           be calculated based on hints of individual cells. This operation
           mode is more flexible, but more complex and heavy to calculate as
           well. Weight properties are handled as a boolean expand. Negative
           alignment will be considered as 0.5. This is the default.

           Todo: @Evas.Object_Table.Homogeneous_Mode.none should balance weight.

           @Evas.Object_Table.Homogeneous_Mode.table
           When homogeneous is relative to table the own table size is divided
           equally among children, filling the whole table area. That is, if
           table has $WIDTH and $COLUMNS, each cell will get _WIDTH /
           COLUMNS_ pixels. If children have minimum size that is larger
           than this amount (including padding), then it will overflow and be
           aligned respecting the alignment hint, possible overlapping sibling
           cells. Weight hint is used as a boolean, if greater than zero it
           will make the child expand in that axis, taking as much space as
           possible (bounded to maximum size hint). Negative alignment will be
           considered as 0.5.

           @Evas.Object_Table.Homogeneous_Mode.item
           When homogeneous is relative to item it means the greatest minimum
           cell size will be used. That is, if no element is set to expand,
           the table will have its contents to a minimum size, the bounding
           box of all these children will be aligned relatively to the table
           object using evas_object_table_align_get(). If the table area is
           too small to hold this minimum bounding box, then the objects will
           keep their size and the bounding box will overflow the box area,
           still respecting the alignment. Weight hint is used as a
           boolean, if greater than zero it will make that cell expand in that
           axis, toggling the *expand mode*, which makes the table behave
           much like @Evas.Object_Table.Homogeneous_Mode.table, except that the
           bounding box will overflow and items will not overlap siblings. If
           no minimum size is provided at all then the table will fallback to
           expand mode as well.]]
