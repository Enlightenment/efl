/**
 * @page Example_Edje_Basics Edje basics example
 *
 * In this example, we illustrate how to start using the Edje library,
 * with the very basic one needs to instantiate an Edje object.
 *
 * We place, in the canvas, an Edje object along with a @b red border
 * image to delimit its geometry. After we instantiate the Edje
 * object, we @b have to set a file and a group, within that file, to
 * bind to it. For this example, we're using an EDC file which
 * declares two parts (blue and green rectangles) and an item data:
 * @include basic.edc
 *
 * We start by trying to acces an @b unexistant group in the file, so
 * that you can see the usefulness of edje_object_load_error_get() and
 * edje_load_error_str(). Check that the error message will tell you
 * just that -- a group which didn't exist in the file was called for:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip file_path
 * @until file_path
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip edje_object_add
 * @until }
 *
 * Than, we finally bind our Edje object to @c "example_group",
 * printing a message afterwards:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip file_path, "example_group"
 * @until object_show
 *
 * What follows is a series of Edje API calls which are of general
 * use. The first of them is edje_object_data_get(), which we use to
 * get the value we have put in the @c "example_data" data field, in
 * our EDC object declaration:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip data field in group
 * @until ;
 *
 * Than, we exemplify edje_object_part_exists():
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip Testing if
 * @until ;
 *
 * The next call is to query @c "part_one"'s geometry, relative to the
 * whole Edje object's area. The part will be situated in the middle
 * of the Edje object's, because it has a restricted forced size (we
 * set its minimum size equal to its maximum, for that) and, by
 * default, parts are aligned to the center of their containers:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip part_geometry_get
 * @until x, y, w, h
 *
 * We can grab a direct pointer on the rectangle implementing @c
 * "part_one", by using edje_object_part_object_get(). Since we are
 * not allowed to set properties on it, we just check its color, to
 * assure its really blue, as declared in the EDC:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip color_get
 * @until x, y, w, h
 *
 * The @c "min" and @c "max" EDC properties can be queried with the
 * following calls:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip max_get
 * @until min. size is
 *
 * The next two calls are to make <b>size calculations</b> on our
 * object. Because of the minumim size declared for @c "part_one" part's
 * default state description, that will be our exact minimum
 * size calculated for the group (remember the @c "min" declaration at
 * group level is just a @b hint, not an enforcement). We then
 * exercise the edje_object_size_min_restricted_calc() function,
 * passing a minimum size of 500, in each axis. Since we have @b no
 * object bigger than that, it will be the minimum size calculated, in
 * the end:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip min_calc
 * @until size calculation is
 *
 * @c "part_two" part is there with a purpose: since it extrapolates
 * the Edje object's boundaries, the edje_object_parts_extends_calc()
 * function will report origin coordinates for the rectangle grouping
 * both parts with @b negative values, indicating it extrapolates to
 * the upper left of our group, just as we see it.
 *
 * To interact with the last features exemplified in the program,
 * there's a command line interface.  A help string can be asked for
 * with the 'h' key:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip commands
 * @until ;
 *
 * Those commands will change the scaling factors of our Edje objects.
 * The first of them, @c 's', will change Edje's @b global scaling
 * factor between @c 1.0 (no scaling) and @c 2.0 (double
 * scale). Scaling will be applied to @c "part_one", only, because
 * that's the part flagged to be scaled at EDC level:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip strcmp(ev->keyname, "s") == 0
 * @until }
 *
 * Note, finally, that the @c 's' command will depend on the 'r' one
 * to have its effects applied. The latter will change @c "part_one"'s
 * @b individual scaling factor, which @b overrides Edje's global
 * scaling factor. Only when the individual one is set to zero, will
 * the global one take effect:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip strcmp(ev->keyname, "r") == 0
 * @until }
 *
 * The example's window should look like this picture:
 *

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_swallow Swallow example
 * @dontinclude edje-swallow.c
 *
 * This is a simple example in which we create a rect and swallow it.
 *
 * Focusing on the relevant parts of the code we go right to the creation of our
 * rectangle. It should be noted that we don't resize or show our rect, that is
 * because when an object is swallowed it's geometry and visibility is
 * controlled by the theme:
 * @skip 20
 * @skipline evas_object_rectangle_add
 * @until swallow
 *
 * The other bit of code that is relevant to us now is our check that the
 * swallow worked:
 * @until printf
 *
 * The full source code follows:
 * @include edje-swallow.c
 * @example edje-swallow.c

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_text Edje Text example
 * @dontinclude edje-text.c
 *
 * This example shows how to manipulate TEXT and TEXTBLOCK parts from code.
 *
 * The very first we are going to do is register a callback to react to changes
 * in the text of our parts:
 * @skip _on_destroy
 * @skip static void
 * @until }
 *
 * @skipline text_change
 * @note Since edje_obj represent a group we'll be notified whenever any part's
 * text in that group changes.
 *
 * We now set the text for two our two parts:
 * @until text_set
 * @until text_set
 * @note Since the "part_two" part is a TEXTBLOCK we can use formatting such as
 * @<b@>
 *
 * And we now move on to selection issues, first thing we do is make sure the
 * user can select text:
 * @until select_allow
 *
 * We then select the entire text, and print the selected text:
 * @until printf
 *
 * We now unselect the entire text(set selection to none), and print the
 * selected text:
 * @until printf
 *
 * Our example will look like this:
 *
 * @image html edje-text.png
 * @image rtf edje-text.png
 * @image latex edje-text.eps
 *
 * The full source code follows:
 * @include edje-text.c
 * @example edje-text.c
 *
 * The theme used in this example is:
 * @include text.edc
 * @example text.edc
