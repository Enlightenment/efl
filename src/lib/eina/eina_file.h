 * Here we have a simple callback to print the name of a file and the path that
 * contains it:
 * @skip static
 * @until }
 *
 * We can use this callback in the following call:
 * @skipline eina_file_dir_list
 *
 * The above is a way to print the files in a directory, but it is not the only
 * one:
 * @until iterator_free
 *
 * And now two ways to get more information than just file names:
 * @until iterator_free
 * @until iterator_free
 *
 * The above mentioned ways of getting files on a list may produce the same output, but
 * they have an important difference, eina_file_direct_ls() does @b not call
 * stat, this means that on some systems it might not have file type
 * information. On the other hand, it might be faster than eina_file_stat_ls().
