	1.0.0 release

2008-04-28  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fixed allocation of a list (EET_G_LIST) of simple types
	(IS_SIMPLE_TYPE) to alloc the correct amount (using the correct type 
	offset). Also fixed a hash (EET_G_HASH) of simple types too.

2008-05-14  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix conversion from a text to a hash (EET_G_HASH).

	* Fix inlined string (EET_T_INLINED_STRING) dump/undump by introducing
	the new word for the parser 'inlined'.

2008-05-15  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix a typo preventing the parsing of unsigned int (EET_T_UINT).

	* Fix group of simple type by implicitly creating a structure with
	the simple type in it.

	* Remove dead code handling group of simple type and put assert
	instead.

2008-05-16  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix eet_data_descriptor3_new as it purpose was to introduce
	str_direct_alloc/str_direct_free usage. Application should now receive
	direct pointer to read only (mmaped) string.

	* Fix EET_FILE_MODE_READ_WRITE when file doesn't exist.

	* Fix some miss use of efn->offset.

	* Introduce unit test in EFL. The current set provide an overall
	coverage rate of 2111 of 2607 lines (81.0%) for eet. It helped
	finding and fixing the bugs of the last three days.
	  The test suite is based on library check. At this time we need
	cvs version, look at http://check.sourceforge.net/ to find it.
	  The covering is done by gcov
	  The html report is done by lcov version 1.6 or above.
	You can found it at http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php.

2008-05-19  Cedric BAIL

	* Old Eet file format is now marked as deprecated and accessing old
	file will display a warning. You can already remove completely all

	disable it by default and at some point drop the support completely.

	* Use directly the pointer from the dictionary to do a pointer
	comparison instead of a strcmp.

2008-07-24  Cedric BAIL
