      gesture,tap: Efl.Canvas.Gesture_Tap; [[Emitted when a Tap gesture has been detected.
        A Tap gesture consists of a touch of the screen (or click of the mouse) quickly followed by
        a release. If the release happens too late a @[Efl.Gesture.Events.gesture,long_tap] event will be
        emitted instead.

        A Double-tap gesture consists of two taps on the screen (or clicks of the mouse) in quick
        succession. If the second one is delayed for too long they will be detected as two independent
        @[Efl.Gesture.Events.gesture,tap] events.
      ]]

      gesture,triple_tap: Efl.Canvas.Gesture_Triple_Tap; [[Emitted when a Triple-tap gesture has been detected.

        @[Efl.Gesture.Events.gesture,tap] or @[Efl.Gesture.Events.gesture,double_tap] events.
      ]]

      gesture,long_tap: Efl.Canvas.Gesture_Long_Tap; [[Emitted when a Long-tap gesture has been detected.
        A Long-tap gesture consists of a touch of the screen (or click of the mouse) followed by a release
        after some time. If the release happens too quickly a @[Efl.Gesture.Events.gesture,tap] event will be
        emitted instead.
      ]]

      gesture,momentum: Efl.Canvas.Gesture_Momentum; [[Emitted when a Momentum gesture has been detected.

      gesture,flick: Efl.Canvas.Gesture_Flick; [[Emitted when a Flick gesture has been detected.
      ]]

      gesture,zoom: Efl.Canvas.Gesture_Zoom; [[Emitted when a Zoom gesture has been detected.
        A Zoom gesture consists of two fingers touching the screen and separating ("zoom in") or
        getting closer ("zoom out" or "pinch").
        This gesture cannot be performed with a mouse as it requires more than one pointer.
