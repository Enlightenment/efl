        * It's actually a merge from my local branch upstream so this
          includes many changes.
        * Fixed cursor/selection handling with BiDi text.
        * Fixed many BiDi issues in both textblock and text objects.
        * Cleaned up textblock and font engine a lot.
        * Added auto-alignment to tetxblock and text objects.
        * Added mixedwrap (word wrap, and if a word is too big cut it) support
          to textblock.
        * Renamed a lot of stuff.
        * Made textblock faster, mostly by saving item sizes and caching
          layout items when text doesn't change.
        * Added harfbuzz (ot layouting/shaping and etc) support.
        * Currently you need to set the env var EVAS_USE_OT to '1' in order to
          use OT support (harfbuzz) that will change soon.
        * More code cleanups will be coming in the future. This shipment is
          mostly to get code review started (and also make sure I don't have a
          merging hell later on).

	* Added WBMP loader thanks to Samsung.

	* Started using string objects instead of strings in most of the font engine (everywhere except draw). Haven't removed the paramteres yet, but did mark them as UNUSED. Removing them will be part of a future change.
	* Removed run-time OT toggling support, OT is now fast, no need for that.
	* Renamed all of the intl_props->text_props (because it really changed purpose
	* Fixed spliting/merging of text_props to be fast and good, not hacky and complex like before.
