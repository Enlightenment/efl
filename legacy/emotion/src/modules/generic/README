Generic - emotion backend
=========================

This generic player backend executes a separate player in another
process. It receives the bytes to be drawn on the emotion object through
a shared memory, and communicates with the player through a pipe, using
the player standard input/output.

The player must communicate with emotion using the defined commands
specified in the Emotion_Generic_Plugin.h. It doesn't need to link
against emotion, just include this file for easier implementation.


How does it work?
=================

When the module is initialized for an emotion object, it starts another process
that runs the specified player. The player command line is specified using:

   emotion_object_module_option_set(object, "player", <command>);

A player using libvlc is being provided now, and the generic module internally
checks if the command given was "vlc", in which case it will use this provided
vlc player.

When a file is set to this object, it will send the file name to the player, and
expect an answer that will tell that the player already decoded a bit of the
file, and the video size is already set on the module, so it can allocate a
shared memory with correct size.

The module then allocates the memory, sends a message to the player and expect
an answer. After this last answer, the "open_done" signal is sent and the module
knows that it is ready for playing. Commands sent before the module being ready
are now applied (and play is resumed if necessary).

During this setup stage, info about the file set will be stored in the module,
so commands like meta data get, length get and so will be available to sync
calls like emotion_object_play_length_get();

If the player dies for any reason, a "decode_stop" signal is sent (should change
to something more like an error signal), and if play is called again, it will be
restarted. The playback should start from the same point it was before the
player crashed, if the player supports seek on the current media format).

TODO
====

 - Provide better description for commands;
 - Explain in details the communication emotion <-> player;
 - Make more common functions for players;
 - (maybe) add support for named pipes, so we don't rely on standard in/out
 for communication;
 - Add a detection on the player to know that the emotion process died (so it
 can just exit);
 - shmname should contain the child pid too;
 - better names for commands, maybe add namespace everywhere;


questions
=========

 - Using semaphores to lock the critical region between process, and pthread
   mutexes for the threads inside the player. Should move to only one type
   (semphores or mutexes)?
 - There are 2 inline functions insde Emotion_Generic_Plugin.h to make it easier
   for the player to get the shared memory correctly. Any problem with this?
   Would be good to add more functions/macros to make common tasks like
   parsing commands there too?
 - Should move players to another project (outside of emotion)?


problems
========
 - file_set has some critical time when file is not set yet when we can't call
 some functions (I think only another file_set now);
 - comunication player -> emotion depends on '\n' to delimitate commands, will
 remove this soon (fix this urgently!);
 - need to implement missing APIs;
