    For instance, changes to the current sub-widget in the spotlight (@Efl.Ui.Spotlight.Container.active_element) can be
    animated with a transition.
    This object can also handle user interaction. For example, dragging the sub-widget to one side to get to a
    different sub-widget (like an smartphone home screen).
    Such user interactions should end up setting a new @Efl.Ui.Spotlight.Container.active_element.
    During a transition, the evolution of the current position should be exposed by emitting $pos_update events.
