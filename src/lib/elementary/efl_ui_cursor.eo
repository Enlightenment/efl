{
   [[An interface to define mouse cursors to use when hovering
     over UI widgets.

     The Elementary cursor is an internal smart object used to customize the
     mouse cursor displayed over objects (or widgets). In the most common
     scenario, the cursor decoration comes from the graphical engine Elementary
     is running on. These engines may provide different decorations for cursors,
     and Elementary provides functions to choose them for instance
     X11 cursors.

     By default, Elementary searches cursors only from the engine. Besides
     using cursors provided by the you can also use those
     coming from Edje theme files. Both globally and per widget, Elementary
     can help you store cursors in engines
     only or in Elementary's theme file. To set cursor's hot spot two data
     items must be added to the cursor's theme: "hot_x" and "hot_y" are the
     offset from the upper-left corner of the cursor (coordinates 0,0).

           will be unset.
