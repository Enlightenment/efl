Enlightenment Input Output Library
==================================

This library is intended to provide non blocking IO by using thread for all
operation that may block. It depends only on eina and ecore right now. It
should integrate all the features/functions of Ecore_File that could block.

This should become one day part of what we call the EFL and be a dependence
of E17. Feel free to contribute, help is always appreciated !
