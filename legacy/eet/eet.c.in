@section intro What is Eet?

It is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data
to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file)
and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not
do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is needed, and it was much
simpler to impliment this once here.

It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as image
data for saving to eet files or sending across the network to other
machines, or just writing to arbitary files on the system. All data is
encoded in a platform independant way and can be written and read by any
architecture.

@todo Complete documentation of API
@todo Add fixed and variable array encode/decode support
