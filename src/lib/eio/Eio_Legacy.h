 *
 * @section eio_main_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Eio library is a library that implements an API for asynchronous
 * input/output operation. Most operations are done in a separate thread
 * to prevent lock. See @ref Eio. Some helper to work on data
 * received in Eio callback are also provided see @ref Eio_Helper.
 * It is also possible to work asynchronously on Eina_File with @ref Eio_Map
 * or on Eet_File with @ref Eio_Eet. It comes with way to manipulate
 * eXtended attribute asynchronous with @ref Eio_Xattr.
 *
 * This library is cross-platform and can be compiled and used on
 * Linux, BSD, Opensolaris and Windows (XP and CE). It is heavily
 * based on @ref Ecore_Main_Loop_Group.
 *
 * @section eio_main_compiling How to compile
 *
 * Eio is a library your application links to. The procedure for this is
 * very simple. You simply have to compile your application with the
 * appropriate compiler flags that the @c pkg-config script outputs. For
 * example:
 *
 * Compiling C or C++ files into object files:
 *
 * @verbatim
   gcc -c -o main.o main.c `pkg-config --cflags eio`
   @endverbatim
 *
 * Linking object files into a binary executable:
 *
 * @verbatim
   gcc -o my_application main.o `pkg-config --libs eio`
   @endverbatim
 *
 * See @ref pkgconfig
 *
 * @section eio_main_next_steps Next Steps
 *
 * After you understand what Eio is and installed it on your system
 * you should proceed understand the programming interface.
 *
 * Recommended reading:
 *
 * @li @ref Eio_Helper for common functions and library initialization.
 * @li @ref Eio_List for listing files asynchronous.
 * @li @ref Eio_Management for anyone who want to do a file manager (copy, rm, ...).
 * @li @ref Eio_Map to manipulate files asynchronously (mmap).
 * @li @ref Eio_Xattr to access file extended attributes (xattr).
 * @li @ref Eio_Monitor to monitor for file changes (inotify).
 * @li @ref Eio_Eet to access Eet files asynchronously.
