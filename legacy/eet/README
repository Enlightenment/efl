Requirements:
-------------
Must have:
  libc
  libm
  zlib
  libjpeg
  eina (1.0.0 or better) 
  (For windows you also need: evil)

Optional requirements:
  gnutls (1.7.6 or better)
  openssl

Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of
data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a
zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later
on. It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is
needed, and it was much simpler to implement this once here.

It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as
image data for saving to eet files or sending across the network to
other machines, or just writing to arbitrary files on the system. All
data is encoded in a platform independent way and can be written and
read by any architecture. This data once encoded can be sent to
another process or machine and decoded on the other end without
needing to go into an eet file. Eet can also optionally encrypt files
and use digital signatures (with gnutls or openssl support).

COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

  ./configure
  make
(do this as root unless you are installing in your users directories):
  make install

To get the coverage report:
    make coverage
The report is created in the coverage/ subdir
If you want to be able to run coverage test over eet, you will need gcov 
(usually any distro provides it) and lcov from:
  http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php.
For coverage support you also need "make check" support with the check
library (see below).
 
For compilation with MinGW, fnmatch.h is probably missing. That file can be
found here:
  http://www.koders.com/c/fid2B518462CB1EED3D4E31E271DB83CD1582F6EEBE.aspx
It should be installed in the mingw include directory.

For compilation with mingw32ce, run configure with the option
  --host=arm-wince-mingw32ce

For compilation with cegcc, follow the wiki:
  http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/Category:EFL_Windows_CE

If you want to be able to run "make check", you need library check
  from http://check.sourceforge.net/
