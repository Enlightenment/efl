	1.0.0 release

2011-01-29  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Enabled mempool for object allocation
	* Allow shorter pre-render handler for rect objects if they are
	  invisible

2011-01-30  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* It's actually a merge from my local branch upstream so this
	  includes many changes.
	* Fixed cursor/selection handling with BiDi text.
	* Fixed many BiDi issues in both textblock and text objects.
	* Cleaned up textblock and font engine a lot.
	* Added auto-alignment to tetxblock and text objects.
	* Added mixedwrap (word wrap, and if a word is too big cut it) support
	  to textblock.
	* Renamed a lot of stuff.
	* Made textblock faster, mostly by saving item sizes and caching
	  layout items when text doesn't change.
	* Added harfbuzz (ot layouting/shaping and etc) support.
	* Currently you need to set the env var EVAS_USE_OT to '1' in order to
	  use OT support (harfbuzz) that will change soon.
	* More code cleanups will be coming in the future. This shipment is
	  mostly to get code review started (and also make sure I don't have a
	  merging hell later on).

2011-01-31  ChunEon Park

	* Fix lurking free bug in key grabs.


2011-02-01  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Added WBMP loader thanks to Samsung.

2011-02-01  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Started using string objects instead of strings in most of the
	  font engine (everywhere except draw). Haven't removed the
	  paramteres yet, but did mark them as UNUSED. Removing them will be
	  part of a future change.
	* Removed run-time OT toggling support, OT is now fast, no need for that.
	* Renamed all of the intl_props->text_props (because it really
	  changed purpose
	* Fixed spliting/merging of text_props to be fast and good, not
	  hacky and complex like before.
	* Added "mirrored mode" to table object.

2011-02-07 Brett Nash (nash@nash.id.au)

	* Proxy Objects; Now you can set an image to have a 'source' of
	  another object.  The proxy will display the object as well.  Proxy
	  objects should be mostly complete.
	* Proxy objects should be complete; please report and bugs to me.
	* Partial support for arbitrary clipping.  Final support coming soon
	  (with some other changes).  You can set most objects as a clip on
	  other objects.  This will use the alpha channel of the object as a
	  clip on the object.  This is still buggy.
	* Software support for arbitrary maps.  So you can use any size map
	  (not just 4 points) for maps.  Once again this is a little buggy.

2011-02-02  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* GL engine gets a speculative texture cache to shadow the
	  normal image cache to avoid excess texture uploads when
	  cycling images often. Should improve performance in some
	  cases.

2011-02-12  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix "rediculous scaling size" bug, where scaling images to
	  sizes like 1 billion pixels high or wide caused evas to try
	  allocate scaletables on the stack and the stack just couldn't
	  handle it. Now it only allocates a table for the visible
	  region which will always be sane, and even has insanity
	  checks now. At worst you'll get an unrendered image if the
	  values are silly and some slowness. No crashes.

2011-02-13  Brett Nash (nash@nash.id.au)

	* Fix crash when deleting proxies.  This _technically_ breaks
	  evas engines which realloc engine data when a border is set.
	  Practically no engines do this.  There is a comment there (and
	  if the engine does that border set won't work), in which case
	  a more complex work-around is possible.

2011-02-14  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Added a newline character mode API to textblock. This lets us set
	  the newline behavior to either normal (i.e only break a line, not
	  a paragraph) to "behave as a PS" mode. Default is the latter.
	  The former is the more correct approach but I guess everything else
	  is in e is not yet ready to use it. These API should help with the
	  transition.
	* A lot of textblock speed improvements and reduced memory footprint.

2011-02-16  Jeonghyun Yun

	* Patch from Jeonghyun Yun <jh0506.yun@samsung.com> that
	  improves BMP loader support to handle malformed RLE BMP's that
	  encode more pixels per line than the image actuall has.

2011-02-16  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Dropped Evas_Encoding and moved to use Eina_unicode_utf8 instead.
	* Started showing the unicode replacement character instead of missing
	  glyphs.

2011-02-20  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix bug in font string parsing that can result in a crash if a
	  font element is long enough.
	* Fix convert rgba8888 -> a8 bug so it wont crash.

2011-02-21  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fixed bug with memory access of old utf8 string when
	  comparing prev and cur state with text obj.

2011-02-22  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Fixed a bug in textblock cursor position with empty textblocks.

2011-02-22  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fixed bug smart calc array where it'd nuke the array when nested
	  process calls hapen and leave some objects uncalculated, but
	  removed from the array and marked as needing a calc thus never
	  getting back into the array.

2011-02-27  Vincent Torri

	* Fixed static linking of the bmp, wbmp and tga loaders

2011-03-07  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Fix segv when trying to set gl viewpoint with NULL ctx

2011-03-08  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix problem with different x vsync api between SGI and EXT flavor
        as they have the same base name, but different prototypes
        * Add evas_object_ref() and evas_object_unref() to defer
        deletion of objects until all references are removed

2011-03-09  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix bug with evas_object_del() calling DEL callback BEFORE
        the HIDE one.

2011-03-10  Sung W. Park

	* Fix bug with yinvert handling of native surfaces.

2011-03-10  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix issue with loading alpha BMP's with "check if all pixel alpha
        are 0 or not and then force alpha off if all are 0". This
        means you can never have a 100% empty/transparent BMP though
        in 32bpp mode.

2011-03-11  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add ICO loader to evas (also can load CUR cursor files in theory)

2011-03-14  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add "load from memory" API: evas_object_image_memfile_set() by
        popular demand. Can load an image format from a memory address.

2011-03-15  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix issues with clipping and map.

2011-03-18  Jiyoun Park

	* Fix wrong call to free when using mempool for Evas_Object.

2011-03-19  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Caching and timestamp checker for image files made much more
        pedantic and it checks not just modified timestamp but also
        inode number, size, and on linux, the nanonsecond resolution
        timestamp as well.

2011-03-19  Brett Nash (nash)

	* Proxy: Bypass the clip on smart clipped objects.  This is probably
	what you want if you are using proxies, as it means clips don't cause
	the object to be invisible by the proxy.

2011-03-22  Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri (k-s)

	* Fix build of GL and static modules.
	* Fix ico loader static build.
