        1.0.0 release

2011-01-30  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added "UNDER" cursor mode.
        * Added auto-alignment to text parts, just set text.alignment to -1 to
          activate it. It's only relevant to TEXT parts, textblock objects
          already have that by default.

2011-02-01  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added Mirroring support to edje objects.

2011-02-08  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix invalid memory access by edje alias code.

2011-02-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix use of recursive alias.

2011-02-21  WooHyun Jung

        * Fix missing cursor changed signale on backspace

2011-02-21  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Add built-in cpp (epp) to provide consistent output on all archs/OSes

2011-02-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix propagation of recursive events on existing part.

2011-02-24  Cedric BAIL

	index or name correctly.

2011-02-25  Jihoon Kim

	* Add edje_object_part_text_cursor_pos_{set,get} API

2011-02-27  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added size_range property to TEXT parts in edje files.
	This lets you limit the size of the font that will be used.
	Especially useful when using fit.

2011-03-10  WooHyun Jung

        * Fix: Emit clicked signal on entry if still in - missing.

2011-03-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Correctly propagate recursive event with existing and non existing
	part.

2011-03-11  Cedric BAIL

	* Add PROXY part.

2011-03-19  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Change edje_decc to only use edje_cc as the compiler for security
        and correctness reasons.

2011-03-23  Brett Nash (nash)

	* Move some of edje over to use smart clipper in evas.  This _should_
	be transparent to users.

2011-03-30  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* text.align (only the vertical part) now works for textblock.

2011-04-1  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add Feature: Support explicit shadow direction with extra effect
        param (optional). Default as before.

2011-05-15  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry - New API: added edje_object_part_text_append which appends
	   text to the end of the textblock part. This lets us do cool thing
	   like population of textblock using idler.

2011-05-16  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add new interpolation modes for programs to make animation
        much easier. Added: ACCEL_FAC, DECEL_FAC, SIN_FAC, DIVIS,
        BOUNCE, SPRING (also made short name versions of the long ones
        possible too).

2011-05-19  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry: Don't emit "cursor,changed" when setting the text, because
	   the cursor really didn't change, it's more like a new cursor.
	   Also, when setting position, don't do anything if position is as it
	   was.

2011-05-27  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Improve performance on create/delete of edje objects by using
        evas freeze and thaw calls. May help in certain pathological
        situations.

2011-05-27  Cedric Bail

	* Improve performance by avoiding walking eina_list for nothing
	when deleting member_class.

2011-06-09  Cedric Bail

	* Make it possible to define part.description.max only on one axis.

2011-07-24  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Add signals entry,paste,request,1 (PRIMARY) and entry,paste,request,3 (CLIPBOARD)
          to differentiate between paste types
        * Add entry,selection,all,request for signalling ctrl+a in an entry
        * Add entry,selection,none,request for signalling ctrl+shift+a in an entry
        * Fix entry,paste,request* to be emitted after cursor,changed (fixes middle mouse paste location)

2011-05-27  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix edje_shutdown() being called before all evas objects created
        by edje (edje objects) are gone. Delay internal core shutdown
        until all references gone.

2011-08-03  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Added changed,user signal. This signal indicates the entry
	has changed because of user interaction, i.e not by code.

2011-08-22  Cedric Bail

	* Add collection.group.limits {
	          vertical: "name" value;
	          horizontal: "name" value;
	      }.

	* Add entry input panel layout setting api's

2011-08-10  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Added change information to entry,changed,user

2011-11-03  Jaehwan Kim

	* Transition: Add the "CURRENT" option which causes the edje object move
	      from its current position.

2011-10-04  Govindaraju SM, Prince Kumar Dubey

	* Add Edje multisense that allows playback of samples and
          vibrator control and ultimately beginsd to pave the way for
          more complex audio etc. support.

2011-11-06  David Seikel (onefang)

	* Lua: Added color_class and text_class functions.
	    Still need to write a function for setting the classes of an object.
	    This works for things in OTHER groups using those classes though.
	* Add image, text, textblock (commented out), and edje objects.
	    Very basic support.
	* Add functions for set/get text font, size, and text.
	* Add function for set/get image image.

	* Add full support for evas polygon object.
	* Beefed up the example lua script to show most of the above.
	  Including some handling of size changes.

          as it returned a strduped string and not an internal one, so
          this just formalizes its existing behavior correctly.

2012-01-03  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Fixed undo/redo with IMF.

2012-01-04  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

2012-01-07  David Seikel (onefang)
