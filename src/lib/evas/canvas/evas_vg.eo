            Set how to fill an image object's drawing rectangle given the
            (real) image bound to it.

            Note that if @p w or @p h are smaller than the dimensions of
            @p obj, the displayed image will be @b tiled around the object's
            area. To have only one copy of the bound image drawn, @p x and @p y
            must be 0 and @p w and @p h need to be the exact width and height
            of the image object itself, respectively.

            See the following image to better understand the effects of this
            call. On this diagram, both image object and original image source
            have @c a x @c a dimensions and the image itself is a circle, with
            empty space around it:

            @image html image-fill.png
            @image rtf image-fill.png
            @image latex image-fill.eps

            @warning The default values for the fill parameters are @p x = 0,
            @p y = 0, @p w = 0 and @p h = 0. Thus, if you're not using the
            evas_object_image_filled_add() helper and want your image
            displayed, you'll have to set valid values with this function on
            your object.

            @note evas_object_image_filled_set() is a helper function which
            will @b override the values set here automatically, for you, in a
            given way. */

            interested in: they'll be ignored by the function.
