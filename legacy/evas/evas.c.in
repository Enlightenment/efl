@section intro What is Evas?

Evas is a clean display canvas API for several target display systems that
can draw anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled scaled images,
alpha-blend objects much and more.

It abstracts any need to know much about what the characteristics of your
display system are or what graphics calls are used to draw them and how. It
deals on an object level where all you do is create and manipulate objects
in a canvas, set their properties, and the rest is done for you.

Evas optimises the rendering pipeline to minimise effort in redrawing changes
made to the canvas and so takes this work out of the programmers hand,
saving a lot of time and energy.

It's small and lean, designed to work on embedded systems all the way to
large and powerful multi-cpu workstations. It can be compiled to only have
the features you need for your target platform if you so wish, thus keeping
it small and lean. It has several display back-ends, letting it display on
several display systems, making it portable for cross-device and
cross-platform development.


@section work How does Evas work?

Evas is a canvas display library. This is markedly different from most
display and windowing systems as a Canvas is structural and is also a state
engine, wheras most display and windowing systems are immediate mode display
targets. Evas handles the logic between a structural display via its' state
engine, and controls the target windowing system in order to produce
rendered results of the current canvases state on the display.

Immediate mode display systems retain very little, or no state. A program
will execute a series of commands:

@verbatim
bitmap_handle = create_new_bitmap();
draw_line(0, 0, 100, 200);
draw_rectangle(10, 30, 50, 500);
draw_bitmap(10, 30, bitmap_handle);
etc.
@endverbatim

The series of commands is executed by the windowing system and the results
are displayed on the screen (normally). Once the commands are executed the
display system has little or no idea of how to reproduce this image again,
and so has to be instructed by the application how to redraw sections of the
screen whenever needed. Each sucessive command will be executed as
instructed by the application and either emulated by software or sent to the
graphics hardware on the device to be performed.

The advantage of such a system is that it is simple, and gives a program
tight control over how something looks and is drawn. Given the increasing
complexity of displays and demands by users to have better looking
interfaces, more and more work is needing to be done at this level by the
internals of widget sets, custom display widgets and other programs. This
means more and more logic and display rendering code needs to be written
time and time again, each time the application needs to figure out how to
minimise redraws so that display is fast and interactive, and keep track of
redraw logic. The power comes at a high-price, lots of extra code and work.
Programmers not very familiar with graphics programming will often make
mistakes at this level and produce code that is sub optimal. Those familiar
with this kind of programming will simply get bored by writing the same code
again and again.

Evas is a structural system in which the programmer creates and manages
display objects and their properties, and as a result of this higher level
state management, the canvas is able to redraw the set of objects when
needed to represent the current state of the canvas.

For example:

@verbatim
bitmap_handle = create_bitmap();
move(bitmap_handle, 10, 30);
show(bitmap_handle);
rectangle_handle = create_rectangle();
move(rectangle_handle, 10, 30);
resize(rectangle_handle, 50, 500);
show(rectangle_handle);
line_handle = create_line();
set_line_coords(line_handle, 0, 0, 100, 200);
show(line_handle);
etc.
@endverbatim

This may look longer, but when the display needs to be refreshed or updated,
the programmer only moves, resizes, shows, hides etc. the objects that they
need to change. The programmer simply thinks at the object logic level, and
the canvas software does the rest of the work for them, figuring out what
actually changed in the canvas since it was last drawn, how to most
efficiently redraw he canvas and its contents to reflect the current state,
and then it can go off and do the actual drawing of the canvas.

This lets the programmer think in a more natural way when dealing with a
display, and saves time and effort of working out how to load and display
images, render given the current display system etc. Since Evas also is
portable across different display systems, this also gives the programmer
the ability to have their code ported and display on different display
systems with very little work.

Evas can be seen as a display system that stands somewhere between a widget
set and an immediate mode display system. It retains basic display logic,
but does very little high-level logic such as scrollbars, sliders, push
buttons etc.


@section compiling How to compile using Evas?

Evas is a library your application links to. The proceedure for this is very
simple. You simply have to compile your application with the appropriate
compiler flags that the @p evas-config script outputs. For example:

Compiling C or C++ files into object files:

@verbatim
gcc -c -o main.o main.c `pkg-config --cflags evas`
@endverbatim

Linking object files into a binary executable:

@verbatim
gcc -o my_application main.o `pkg-config --libs evas`
@endverbatim

You simply have to make sure that pkg-config is in your shell's PATH (see
the manual page for your appropriate shell) and evas.pc in /usr/lib/pkgconfig
or its path is in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. It's that simple
to link and use Evas once you have written your code to use it.

Since the program is linked to Evas, it is now able to use any advertised
API calls to display graphics in a canvas managed by Evas, as well as use
the API calls provided to manage data as well.

You should make sure you add any extra compile and link flags to your
compile commands that your application may need as well. The above example
is only guaranteed to make Evas add it's own requirements.
