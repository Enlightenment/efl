             This property sets the playback state of the object. Re-setting the current
             playback state has no effect.

             If set to $false, the object's @.playback_progress property is, by default, reset to $[0.0]. A
             class may alter this behavior, and it will be stated in the documentation for a class
             if such behavior changes should be expected.

             Applying the $false playing state also has the same effect as the player object reaching
             the end of its playback, which may invoke additional behavior based on a class's
             implementation.
