 *
 * A thumb object is used for displaying the thumbnail of an image or video.
 * You must have compiled Elementary with Ethumb_Client support and the DBus
 * service must be present and auto-activated in order to have thumbnails to
 * be generated. You must also have a Session bus, not System bus.
 *
 * Once the thumbnail object becomes visible, it will check if there is a
 * previously generated thumbnail image for the file set on it. If not, it
 * will start generating this thumbnail.
 *
 * Different config settings will cause different thumbnails to be generated
 * even on the same file.
 *
 * Generated thumbnails are stored under @c $HOME/.thumbnails/. Check the
 * Ethumb documentation to change this path, and to see other configuration
 * options.
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 *
 * - "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the thumb without dragging
 *             around.
 * - "clicked,double" - This is called when a user has double-clicked the thumb.
 * - "press" - This is called when a user has pressed down the thumb.
 * - "generate,start" - The thumbnail generation started.
 * - "generate,stop" - The generation process stopped.
 * - "generate,error" - The generation failed.
 * - "load,error" - The thumbnail image loading failed.
 *
 * available styles:
 * - default
 * - noframe
 *
 * An example of use of thumbnail:
