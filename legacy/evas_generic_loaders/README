Evas generic loaders 1.9.0
==========================

******************************************************************************
 FOR ANY ISSUES PLEASE EMAIL:
 enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
******************************************************************************

These are additional "generic" loaders for Evas that are stand-alone
executables that evas may run from its generic loader module. This
means that if they crash, the application loading the image does not
crash also. In addition the licensing of these binaries will not
affect the license of any application that uses Evas as this uses a
completely generic execution system that allows anything to be plugged
in as a loader.

COMPILER FLAGS

You may want to change the install prefix for EFL with:

**NOTE:**

You should put generic loaders in the same prefix as EFL or they will
not be found by EFL at runtime.
