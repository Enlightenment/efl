    [[HTTP Dialer (Client).

      The effective URL in use, if @.allow_redirects is $true will be
      available as @Efl.Net.Socket.address_remote. The
      @Efl.Net.Socket.address_local is an IP:PORT pair.

      The dialer can perform bi-directional information exchanges. It can
      also do a PUT and upload a file, or GET and download one. It can
      also do a POST with some form values, including a file,
      and retrieve its headers and body response. To make usage more
      streamlined, choose your area of interest with @.primary_mode
      then get some properties such as @Efl.Io.Sizer.size to report or
      use the information you need.

      If @.allow_redirects is $true, multiple "connected" and
      "resolved" signals will be dispatched, one for each
      connection. In this case @.response_status and @.response_headers_get
      will keep changing. Using @.response_headers_all_get one can see
      the whole history of headers and connections.

      To enable debugging use EINA_LOG_LEVELS=ecore_con:4 environment
      variable.

      If the proxy is $NULL (default), then the system proxy will be
      used. On UNIX that's the environment variable $http_proxy (or
      '$all_proxy') is used if the given address doesn't match
      $no_proxy patterns. To disable proxy use an empty string. If
      provided, the proxy must use one of the following protocols:

       - http://username:password\@proxyserver:port
       - http://username\@proxyserver:port
       - http://proxyserver:port
       - http://proxyserver  (default port 1080)
       - socks5://username:password\@proxyserver:port (SOCKSv5)
       - socks5h://username\@proxyserver:port (let socks server to resolve domain)
       - socks5://proxyserver:port
       - socks5://proxyserver (default port 1080)
       - socks4a://proxyserver:port (SOCKSv4 and let socks server to resolve domain)
