Elementary is a basic widget set library that is easy to use and is based on
EFL. It provides the basic building blocks for creating applications and user
interfaces.

For more details about elementary widgets and how to use them kindly refer to
the following link for the latest documentation:

COMPONENTS
----------

**Library:**

//LGPL v2 license//

The library you will find in src/lib/ and modules it loads as demos or
actual implementations in src/modules/. The library depends on at
least on default theme that is built in data/themes/ and some default
config installed from config/.

**Theme:**

The default theme is large and includes data for every widget and then
some. The Theme includes some images that are creative-commons
licensed (see COPYING.images) and is otherwise considered LGPL as well
as the library.

**Test App:**

There is a full test app in src/bin/ and you will find its main source
as test.c with every test split into test_*.c files. This should serve
as a general tester for Elementary as well as example code on writing
UIs with Elementary. Run this app (once installed) with elementary_test.

**Configuration App:**

A simple rough configuration tool is provided called
elementary_config. This tool allows you to play with some basic
configuration of elementary and it saves your config in your home
directory in ~/.elementary as well as applying it to all Elementary
using applications. Themes are normally looked for in
~/.elementary/themes and the system elementary data dir
(PREFIX/share/elementary/themes/).


COMPILING AND INSTALLING
------------------------

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

If you have doxygen, then you can build documentation with:

    make doc

You will find documentation in the doc/ directory.


COMPILER FLAGS
--------------

You likely don't need static libraries most of the time so you can
disable them with:

    --disable-static

You may want to change the install prefix for EFL with:

    --prefix=/path/to/prefix
        
There are also examples in src/examples/ as well. To compile examples
use this option to configure:

    --enable-build-examples

Also you may wish to install the examples, then use:

    --enable-install-examples


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Elementary requires EFL to be installed and available first.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Configuration for a user is normally stored in ~/.elementary/config,
but if this does not exist, the system configuration in
PREFIX/share/elementary/config is used instead. Overriding either of
these is per-screen or per-virtual-desktop configuration that may be
stored on the root window as a property in X11 or via appropriate
other protocols depending on display system.

By default the profile.cfg file contains a config key that indicates
the name of the profile to use. See config/Makefile.am as to how to
generate this. The directories each contain per-profile configuration.
The cfg files are files generated by Eet and can be generated from
text. See the above Makefile.am
